# Projet-unity-AR-and-VR-
## Scope
In the face of the Covid pandemic, e-commerce has become popular as a means to obtain dailynecessities while staying safe. The imaginary furniture company IQEA has decided to jump on the bandwagon. With the progress of augmented and virtual reality technologies, they would like to raise the attractiveness of their products by offering a virtual hands-on experience, and entice consumers to open up their wallets.
The goal of this project is to design an Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications in the topic of e-commerce application for IQEA.
The user will have the opportunity to choose the furnitures desired for his home through a catalogue in different categories such as for size ( Small / Medium / Large ) 
The display of firniture will be animated with rotation and sound for more attraction.
The user can eventually place the furniture as his desire.
The Virtual application has an extended option which is the collision detection, if the user collides with an object the application will inform him by making a sound of alert and colouring the object in which he collided with.

For further details you can upload the applications packages through github and test the two applications seperately. 
There is a power point presentation that defines the AR and VR, explains more about the applications made in this project and further more there is a video in the github repository that shows the test we made for both of the VR-AR Apps.
